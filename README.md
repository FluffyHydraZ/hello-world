# hello-world
This repository is for practising Github and getting used to its features. 


I am an aspiring developer so this seems like a good skill to have. Currently I am using 2 keyboards, don't question it its more fun to switch back and forth. Keep my fingers guessing.

Now it is time to actually make the changes......oooops I meant commit the changes. yeah we're programming with gusto now.
